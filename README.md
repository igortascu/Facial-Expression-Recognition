# Facial-Expression-Recognition

#### Feature Extraction using Dlib
In Dlib's 68 facial **landmark** detector, each of the 68 landmarks corresponds to a specific facial feature. These landmarks are a standard way to map the human face, allowing for detailed facial analysis. Here is an explanation of what each group of landmarks represents:

- **Jawline (1-17)**: These landmarks trace the jawline from ear to ear.

- **Right Eyebrow (18-22)**: These points map the right eyebrow.

- **Left Eyebrow (23-27)**: These points map the left eyebrow.

- **Nose Bridge (28-31)**: These landmarks follow the line of the bridge of the nose.

- **Lower Nose (32-36)**: These points outline the bottom part of the nose, including the nostrils.

- **Right Eye (37-42)**: This set maps out the right eye, including the corners and the eyelid.

- **Left Eye (43-48)**: Similarly, these landmarks map out the left eye.

- **Outer Lip (49-60)**: These points follow the outer edge of the lips, both the top and bottom lips.

- **Inner Lip (61-68)**: These landmarks trace the inner edge of the lips.
